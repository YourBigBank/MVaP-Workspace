## Why don't founders care about transparency

Transparency shouldn't only be reserved for your external stakeholders. It's most valuable for members within your organization.

This might sound like what you need is to regurgitate the same things that you discuss in private meetings, but that's not necessarily the case.

The goal of internal transparency is to find non-obvious insights about the business that your team members can use to make decisions.

_But where can you find those insights?_

The answer is found at the most atomic level - they're found in the math that your business operates on.

* Finances (Cashflows i.e. Revenue & Expenses)
* Operations (Marketing, Retention, Growth KPIs)
