## The Good the Bad and the Stunning:

Hey!

If you came to this guide looking to learn how to get your books done I have good news, bad news and stunning news.

Bad news is that we’re not done with this yet. We are going through the last round of edits for the first draft and the Oct 16th deadline got in the way. WTF right?

The Good news is that you can sign up here for a reminder once this is done. (If I have your contact info I’ll follow up anyways.)

The stunning news is if you need to get your bookkeeping done the option of working with me 1 on 1 or hiring my team is still on the table!

So book a call and let’s find the best path for you:&#x20;

## Introduction #2



Listen listen listen

I can already imagine if this is your first time going through it that you’re probably worried IF you can finish it.

I’m here to tell you that you can.

And most likely you will.

As long as you follow a few rules of engagement

\#1 give yourself TIIIIIIMMME

* If you’re going to try and do all the books immediately…this is going to suck

\#2 if you don’t understand something…

* Phone a friend for help
* hop into our community and ask for help
* book a call with us! We are going to get though this together.

\#3 break the work down into tasks that you can complete over time!

* you ain’t gonna sit here and do all this shit in one go unless you’ve got the good drugs lol
* but in the event that you want to do that anyway I want to reassure you that I do it once a week, sober, and I come out mildly happy on the other side

So yeah!

It’s really not that bad.

It’s just a few numbers and words.

In fact, I’ve got the perfect background noise for you to listen to while you get through this (click here)

So good luck and see you on the other side!\

Transparency has become a hot topic in the business community lately. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your organization.

Investors want to know that you're taking care of them in the right way.

Customers want to know you're not taking advantage of them in the wrong way.

But isn't there someone else in the room we should be considering?

### Introduction #3

## Why don't founders care about transparency?

Transparency shouldn't only be reserved for your external stakeholders. It's most valuable for members within your organization.

This might sound like what you need is to regurgitate the same things that you discuss in private meetings, but that's not necessarily the case.

The goal of internal transparency is to find non-obvious insights about the business that your team members can use to make decisions.

_But where can you find those insights?_

The answer is found at the most atomic level - they're found in the math that your business operates on.

* Finances (Cashflows i.e. Revenue & Expenses)
* Operations (Marketing, Retention, Growth KPIs)

This guide will give step-by-step instructions that shows business owners, CFOs, DAO representatives, or any member of a crypto organization how to derive deep actionable insights from their business using the power of strategic accounting.
