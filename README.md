## The Good the Bad and the Stunning:

Hey!

If you came to this guide looking to learn how to get your books done I have good news, bad news and stunning news.

Bad news is that we’re not done with the guide yet. We are going through the last round of edits for the first draft and the Oct 16th tax deadline got in the way. WTF right?

The Good news is that you can [sign up here](https://airtable.com/appA4CWZGrJMTRIuh/shrlpD2vCrhmuEUDh) for a reminder once this is done. (If I have your contact info I’ll follow up anyways.)

The stunning news is if you need to get your bookkeeping done the option of [working with me 1 on 1 or hiring my team](https://calendly.com/ousmane-toure/accounting-help) is still on the table!

So [book a call](https://calendly.com/ousmane-toure/accounting-help) and let’s find the best path for you:&#x20;

## Ready To Work on Your Books?

Yes? Okay let's go!&#x20;

But first, I can already imagine if this is your first time going through it that you’re probably worried _**IF**_ you can finish it.

I’m here to tell you that _**you can**_.

And most likely _**you will**_.

As long as you follow **a few rules** of engagement

1. **Give yourself TIIIIIIMMME**
   * If you’re going to try and do all the books immediately…this is going to suck
2. **If you don’t understand something...**
   * Phone a friend for help
   * [Hop into our community](https://airtable.com/appA4CWZGrJMTRIuh/shroJ2rAqw5aydbjH) and ask for help
   * [Book a call with us!](https://calendly.com/ousmane-toure/accounting-help) We are going to get though this together.
3. Break the work down into tasks that you can complete over time!
   1. FYI We already did this part for you and will take your feedback to make it better over time.
   2. This means you ain’t gotta sit here and do all this stuff in one go unless you’ve got good drugs lol (we don't advocate for using any)
   3. But in the event that you want to do that anyway I want to reassure you that I do it once a week, sober, and I come out mildly happy on the other side

So yeah!

It’s really not that bad.

It’s just some numbers and words.

In fact, I’ve got the perfect background noise for you to listen to while you get through this (click here)
