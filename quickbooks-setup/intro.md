# Intro:

Have you had an accountant in the past?

Self setup

Gathering information and documents:

* Bank statements
* Account information
* Passwords

Put into a google drive for each client

Sent over to the bookkeeper

Bookkeeper gains access to the books

Ous and Nikky have a call to go over what the client is looking for, what they need done for each year.

If the bank accounts won't link properly, go invidually into each bank statement (Excel, CSV) and import statements into Quickbooks manually.

Once everything is synced, do a cleanup:

* Categorize every transaction
* Expense, transfer, payment

After transactions are categorized, talk with the client to figure out the remaining transactions to figure out what they are and categorize properly.

Reconcile every account for every month of the year. Ensure that what is in Quickbooks matches with their bank balances. Usually not a problem if there's an import, when they're not linked there's a lot of discrepancies. There should be $0.00 difference between bank statements and Quickbooks. Compare a bank statement ending balance to Quickbooks ending balance. If there are any transactions that are in the bank and not in Quickbooks, those transactions are put into Google sheets or Excel. Formatted as above _(Line 18)_, DATE-Transaction-AMT. Import those transactions into Quickbooks, categorize them, go back to do the reconciliation and that should work. ;)
