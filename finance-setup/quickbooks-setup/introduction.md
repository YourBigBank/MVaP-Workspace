# Introduction

Transparency has become a hot topic in the business community lately. Everyone wants to know what's going on in your organization.

Investors want to know that you're taking care of them in the right way.

Customers want to know you're not taking advantage of them in the wrong way.

But isn't there someone else in the room we should be considering?\
\
Yes, that's you the founder.

## Why don't founders care about transparency?

Transparency shouldn't only be reserved for your external stakeholders. It's most valuable for you and members within your organization.

The goal of internal transparency is to find non-obvious insights about the business that your team members can use to make decisions.

_But where can you find those insights?_

The answer is found at the most atomic level - they're found in the math that your business operates on.

* Finances (Cashflows i.e. Revenue & Expenses)
* Operations (Marketing, Retention, Growth KPIs)
