# Introduction - QuickBooks Setup

Yes, that's you the founder. You're the person that needs transparency the most.  \
\
Why? Because _**real-time data**_, _**streamlined bookkeeping**_, and _**accurate financial statements**_ will provide you insights into your business that will help you continuously steer your business in the direction of _**higher revenue**_, _**lower expenses**_, and _**improved profitability**_.

## Why should founders care about transparency?

Transparency shouldn't only be reserved for your external stakeholders. It's most valuable for you and members within your organization.

The goal of internal transparency is to find non-obvious insights about the business that your team members can use to make decisions.

_But where can you find those insights?_

They're found in the math that your business operates on.

* Financial Statements (Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, Statement of Cashflows)
* Operational Data&#x20;
  * Rev Ops (Marketing + Sales Cashflows i.e. Revenue & Expenses)
  * Fin Ops (Sales Forecasts, Budgets, Long Term Plans)
  * Cash Flow Managements (Treasury, Bank, and Credit Balances)
  * Management (Goals, OKRs, KPIs)
  * Fulfillment KPIs

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Fulfillment KPIs</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>New Clients</td><td>New Projects (existing Clients)</td><td>Annual Contract Value</td></tr><tr><td>Customer <br>Effort Score</td><td>Customer Retention Cost</td><td>Customer <br>Retention Rate</td></tr><tr><td>Customer <br>Satisfaction Score</td><td>First Contact Resolution Rate</td><td>Gross Revenue <br>Retention</td></tr></tbody></table>

This guide will only cover how to take real-time data and use streamlined bookkeeping process to create timely and accurate financial statements.&#x20;

**The Moral:** _Financial Awareness leads to Financial Opportunity._

But once you have got that out of the way come back to this page and ask yourself.

How can I collect data to calculate the remainder of these?&#x20;
