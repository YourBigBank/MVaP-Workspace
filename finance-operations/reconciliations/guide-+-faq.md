<summary>What should I look for to know if I Reconciled Bank/Credit Card Accounts correctly?</summary>

To know if you have reconciled your bank and credit card accounts correctly in QuickBooks, you should look for the following indicators and perform certain checks:

1. Zero Difference: The most straightforward sign of a successful reconciliation is that the "Difference" amount on the reconciliation summary screen in QuickBooks should be $0. This means that the balance in QuickBooks matches the ending balance on your bank or credit card statement for the specified period.
2. Cleared Transactions: All transactions that have cleared your bank or credit card account should be marked as "Cleared" in QuickBooks. This indicates that you have accounted for all cleared transactions during the reconciliation process.
3. Reconciliation Report: QuickBooks generates a reconciliation report when you complete the reconciliation process. Review this report to ensure that it accurately reflects the transactions you reconciled, including any adjustments or discrepancies.
4. Matching Transactions: Compare the list of transactions in QuickBooks that were marked as cleared during the reconciliation to the transactions on your bank or credit card statement. They should match in terms of date, amount, and description.
5. Beginning and Ending Balances: The beginning balance on your reconciliation should match the beginning balance on your bank or credit card statement for the selected period. Similarly, the ending balance on the reconciliation should match the ending balance on the statement.
6. Correctly Categorized Transactions: Verify that all transactions in QuickBooks are categorized correctly as income, expenses, transfers, or other appropriate categories. Incorrect categorization can impact your financial statements.
7. Tax Classification: Ensure that transactions are classified correctly for tax purposes. For example, interest income should be classified as such, and expenses should be categorized appropriately for tax deductions.
8. Consistency: Consistency is key. If you have reconciled previous periods, ensure that the balances match those on your previous reconciliation reports.
9. Record of Adjustments: If you needed to make adjustments during the reconciliation process (e.g., adding missing transactions or correcting errors), verify that these adjustments were recorded accurately in QuickBooks.
10. Reconciliation Frequency: Check that you are reconciling your bank and credit card accounts at the appropriate frequency (e.g., monthly, quarterly) and that you haven't missed any periods.
11. Bank Statements: Keep copies of your bank and credit card statements as documentation. You can cross-reference these statements with your reconciliation reports.
12. Auditing: Consider conducting periodic internal audits of your reconciliation process to ensure accuracy and compliance.
13. Professional Review: If you are uncertain about the reconciliation process or if your business has complex financial transactions, consider having a professional accountant or bookkeeper review your reconciliations periodically.

By following these steps and checks, you can confirm that your bank and credit card accounts are reconciled correctly in QuickBooks, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of your financial records.
